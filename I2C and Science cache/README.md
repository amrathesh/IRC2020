# Science Cache

These are the codes which enable support of science cache codes by communicating arduino with rpi. Helps to get sensor values to monitor science task perfectly. 

##  Usage guidance

- Arduino Mega is used. The appropriate connections can be taken from the connection diagram
- Serial Communication is performed between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The list of single character commands is given by the
  command log file
- Various test codes used for completing this are in the test folder.
