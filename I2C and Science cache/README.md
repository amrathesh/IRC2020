#Science Cache

These are the codes which enable support of science cache codes by communicating arduino with rpi. Helps to get sensor values to monitor science task perfectly. 

##Usage guidance

- rakNamScienceCache.py takes care of retrieval of code from sensors and also communication from rpi to laptop using http get requests over local internet.
- Various test codes used for completing this are in the test folder.
